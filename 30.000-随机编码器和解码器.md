### 3.随机编码器和解码器






## where 

* 目前自编码器的应用主要有两个方面，
    * 传统的自编码器被用于降维和特征学习
    * 自编码器与隐变量模型理论的联系将自编码器带到了生成式建模的前沿。

* 关于预训练与深度学习
    * Stacks of unsupervised feature learning layers are STILL useful when you are in a regime with insufficient labeled examples, 
    for transfer learning or domain adaptation. It is a regularizer.  But when the number of labeled examples becomes large enough,
    the advantage of that regularizer becomes much less.I suspect however that this story is far from ended!
    There are other ways besides pre-training of combining supervised and unsupervised learning, 
    and I believe that we still have a lot to improve in terms of our unsupervised learning algorithms. 

* 语义hash，降维可以使用信息检索更快。
* And recently where Autoencoders trained in an adversarial manner could be used as generative models
